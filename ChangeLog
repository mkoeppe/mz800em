2002-01-22  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Version 0.8

	* graphics.c, mz800gtk.c, mz800vga.c, pckey.c: More work on the
	GTK+ frontend.

2002-01-21  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* Makefile, README, TODO, mz800gtk.c, mz800vga.c, pckey.c,
	graphics.c, graphics.h, main.c, mz700em.h, mz800win.c, mzterm.c:
	Factored out a lot of functions into mz800gtk.c, mz800win.c,
	pckey.c, and mz800vga.c, saving a million #ifdefs.  Removed all
	the buggy VGA16 code.  Started GTK+ frontend.

1999-04-07  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Version 0.7.2

1999-04-06  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* z80.h, z80.c, mzterm.c, main.c, graphics.h, graphics.c, disk.c:
	  Fixed compiler warnings; removed ^M from the sources.

1999-03-21  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* Version 0.7.1

1999-03-14  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mz80/makez80.c: Fixed special-memory read bug.
	
	* mzterm.c: Fixed DEL bug.

1999-03-02  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mz80/...: Clean-up.  New `makez80' with option `-dm' creates the
	code that `makez80f' used to create. 
	
	* mz80supp.c, main.c: Using mz80f?ReleaseTimeslice() instead of
	cycles-remaining hack.

1999-02-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Version 0.7
	
	* README: Documentation fixes.

	* mzterm.c, main.c [Windows-32]: Reads keyboard only if active.

1999-01-30  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mz80supp.c, main.c: We can now have USE_MZ80 with
	TWO_Z80_COPIES. On my 486-25, the emulator then runs at 4.5
	Bogo-MHz.

	* Makefile, mz80supp.c: MZ80 support now for MZ80 version 2.6. The
	hacked-in makez80 -lw option has been replaced by the official -nt
	option.

	* z80.h, z80.c, mz700em.h, main.c: TWO_Z80_COPIES support. We
	include two copies of our Z80 core into the code; one that is like
	the traditional one, and one that has all memory mapping disabled
	(using direct memory access). The latter one is active when the
	machine is in 64KB RAM mode. 
	
1999-01-29  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* main.c: Removed all `FUNNY_LPT_LOOPBACK' code.

1999-01-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mz80/makez80.c, mz80/Makefile: The MZ80 code generator now
	supports the -lw (`light-weight cycle-counting') option. This will
	produce code with much less of cycle-counting, making everything
	much faster. On my 486-25, the MZ80 version now runs at 4.1
	Bogo-MHz (3.3 Bogo-Mhz before; old emulator 2.5 Bogo-MHz). 

	* mz700em.h, main.c, graphics.c: Moved update_screen() from main.c
	to graphics.c.

1999-01-16  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Version 0.6.3

	* main.c, disk.c: Fixed problem with non-existing directories.

1999-01-15  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mz80supp.c, main.c: MZ80 now works very well, both at
	emulated-speed and infinite-speed. [Just the game that needed the
	pending_interrupts_hack() doesn't work for obvious reasons... But
	there is a better way than plugging this hack into MZ80: Scale
	down the number of cycles executed properly.] On my 486-25, MZ80
	runs 30% faster than the traditional emulator; but on my
	Pentium-120, both run at roughly the same speed.

	* z80.c, mz80supp.c, main.c: Changed reset() logic; works better
	with MZ80 this way. 

	* mzterm.c: Update column counter when printing
	characters. PRINT/P TAB() should work now.

	* mz80/makez80.c: Changed the OTDR thingy (also sent a patch to
	Neil Bradley).

1999-01-14  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mz80/Makefile, mz80supp.c: New module, interfacing to the MZ80
	(`multi Z80 emulator') by Neil Bradley. The MZ80 kernel is meant
	to optionally replace the current kernel (z80.c, z80ops.c,
	cbops.c, edops.c).

	* main.c [Linux]: Changed signal code; now works with glibc. Fixed
	minor bug in dontpanic().
	
1999-01-13  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Version 0.6.2

	* mzterm.c [Windows-32]: New compiler option MZISHPRINTER omits
	CR->CRLF conversion if set. This allows EPSON printers configured
	for connection with an MZ be used with the emulator.

1999-01-12  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Version 0.6.1

	* mzterm.c [Windows-32]: Fixed Num-lock handling. Printer now opened 
	  as a binary file. 

1999-01-10  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

        * Version 0.6
	
	* Windows-32: The system now works smoothly even with Windows95.
	  Palette functions disabled since not working this way in
	  Windows95.  Timing not yet ready for games.
	  
	* Linux: Printing support via GNU enscript; providing
	  emulator-side HCOPY command, using pnm2ps.

1998-11-28  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* main.c, disk.c, graphics.c, graphics.h, Makefile, mzterm.c:
	Added support for the Cygwin version. This is still a quick hack,
	but runs quite well (using Cygwin Beta 20).

	* mz800win.h, mz800win.c, scancode.h: New files for the Cygwin
	(Windows-32) version.

1998-11-14  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* main.c: The `real timer' support (`-r' option) is no longer
 	available by default (it was alpha anyway); you must compile with
 	REAL_TIMER defined to get it back.

1998-11-08  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Started hacking at the Windows-32 version (using Cygwin).

1998-11-05  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* Version 0.5

	* main.c: Fixed/unified color handling in MZ700/MZ800 mode.

1998-11-03  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* z80.c: New RISKY_REGS define.

	* mzterm.c: Fixed the DEL key.

	* README: Documentation fixes.

1998-11-01  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mzterm.c, mz700em.h: Unified break handling.

	* graphics.c: Removed the graphic artefacts that occured when
	switching from MZ700-mode to MZ800-mode (introduced
	`resetcolorplanes').

	* main.c: If invoked with the new option `-7', the emulator starts
	as if it were an MZ-700 (the MZ-1Z013A/B monitor is
	entered). Otherwise, the MZ-800 IPL is entered; you have to type
	`M' to get to the MZ-9Z504M monitor.

	* main.c: Made printer port access conditional (define
	ALLOW_LPT_ACCESS); no longer enabled by default.

1998-10-31  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mzterm.c, mz700em.h, main.c: Added auto-repeat mollifier for
	mzterm-ish keyboard input. (MZ BASIC programs typically expect
	unbuffered input, which is simulated better this way.)
	
1998-10-25  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* mzterm.c: Added mzterm-ish printer and date support. Some fixes
	with mzterm-ish keyboard.

	* z80.h, edops.c: mztermservice now has an additional parameter,
	in which the A register is passed.
	
1998-10-24  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* edops.c, z80.h, main.c, z80.c: The MZ800 monitor MZ-9Z504M
	(which is invoked by typing JE800 at run-time or defining MZ800IPL
	at compile-time) now also has a patched L command.

	* main.c: Checking for PCG RAM changes in update_scrn(); updating
	characters with changed appearance.

	* main.c: Fixed block cursor keys.

	* z80.c, cbops.c, edops.c, z80ops.c: More regular register
	structure (define USE_REGS) and use of a x86 register for pc make
	the emulator faster.
	
	* z80.c, z80.h, cbops.c, edops.c, z80ops.c, Makefile, disk.c,
	mzterm.c: New options COPY_BANKSWITCH, SLOPPY_2, HEAVY_LOAD,
	USE_REGS, NO_COUNT_TSTATES make the Z80 kernel much faster. In
	COPY_BANKSWITCH mode, bankswitching is performed by copying
	memory; operation fetch and data load are distinguished: fetch
	never does mmio, is therefore much faster. In SLOPPY_2 mode,
	2-byte memory operations at the edge of different memory types
	will be wrong; but all operations will be somewhat faster.

Fri Oct 16 00:00:28 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* edops.c, z80.h: New pseudo instruction `ed fa' for mzterm.

	* main.c, mz700em.h, Makefile: Added mzterm support. 

	* mzterm.c: New module, supporting a subset of mzterm's services
 	(these are only accessible from a special patched BASIC
 	version). This includes the new keyboard access, implementing a
 	German layout.
	
Thu Oct 15 17:17:10 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* main.c, Makefile: Keyboard handling now uses libvga instead of
	 librawkey. 

Mon Oct  5 22:48:14 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Version 0.4

	* main.c, graphics.c: Moved all MZ800 graphics code from main.c to
 	the new graphics.c module. Final fixes with PLANE A/B support.

Sun Oct  4 17:47:41 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* main.c: Added support for virtual BASIC floppy disks (disk.c
 	module).

	* README: Documented BASIC floppy hacks.

	* edops.c, z80.h: New pseudo instructions `ed fc', `ed ff',
 	supporting BASIC floppy access.

	* disk.c: New module, providing virtual floppy disk
 	support. Either takes MZ disk images, or maps Unix directories
 	containing `*.btx' files to a MZ directory.

	* cbops.c: Fixed BIT n,(HL) instruction -- don't store value back
 	(caused problems with memory-mapped I/O).

Sat Oct  3 21:52:03 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Added support for 640x200 mode and PLANE A/B.

Fri May  1 00:12:09 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Fixed Makefile; no longer tries to strip the `mzjoinimage' shell
	  script.

Tue Apr 21 22:46:02 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@moose.boerde.de>

	* Version 0.3

Mon Apr 13 19:39:15 1998  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@cs.uni-magdeburg.de>

        * Moved mz700em's `README' to `README-700' and wrote a README
	  (borrowing from `README-700') that talks about mz800em.
	
	* New `mzextract' program can handle MZ800 320KB disk images: View
	  directory, or extract the contained files as single Linux files.
	
	* Added a `snap loader', allowing:
	  - loading an MZF file specified at the command line
	  - specifying a 320KB disk image, which can be booted using the
	    (slightly patched) Initial Program Loader (IPL) 
	  - loading BASIC (or other) programs `from cassette' (you need a
	    slightly patched BASIC interpreter to use this feature, see
	    `README') 

	* Changed a few things in the Z80 emulator:
	  - Use correct high port address in OTD[R], IND[R], OTI[R], INI[R]
	    instructions (`edops.c')
	  - Added two more fake instructions, for disk/CMT support, in
	    `edops.c'
	  - Inserted `pending_interrupts_hack()' in the RETI instruction;
	    this is for throwing sequence of interrupts at a time
	  - Added interrupt support.
	
	* Added support for MZ800 and additional hardware, including:
	  - PCG (Programmable Character Generator) and 2nd charset support
	  - more mode-specific bank switching
	  - MZ800 IPL ROM (at 0xE010--0xFFFF)
	  - MZ800 64K RAM Disk (at ports 0xEA, 0xEB)
	  - experimental printer support 
	  - MZ800 pixel graphics (320x200 mode only)
	  - MZ800 pallet/scroll
	  - PIO, 8255, and 8253 control, providing several interrupt
	    sources (vertical blanking, CONT2 timer, CONT0 timer)

	* Added RESET key -- F11
	
	* Changed font-data bit order (in `main.c' and `unpix.c') to make the
	  font data compatible with the MZ800 PCG ROM format.

Wed Dec  4 15:18:06 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* Version 0.2.

	* README: stuff about transferring ROM.

Mon Nov 11 23:18:51 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* README: documented that sound support sucks rocks even more
	under 2.0.x, due to (seemingly) non-zeroed DMA buffers.

Sat Nov  2 19:01:43 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* main.c: Added sound support.

Sat Nov  2 03:31:40 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* Version 0.1.

Fri Nov  1 02:41:06 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* Started hacking.
